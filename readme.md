### Learning ES6 Journey

- let and Const
    - Variables declaration that helps you to avoid the hoisting behavior caused by the "var" keyword.

    - let: use let when you plan to reassign value to the variable.
    - const: when you don't plan to reassign value to the variable. 

- Template literals(or String literals):
    - Help with string concatenation or string interpolation without using using the "+" operator.

- Destructuring: 
    - Extracting data from an array and object into the individual variables.

    - There is: array destructuring, object destructuring, defaultValue Destructuring, nested destructuring. (What I learnt so far.)
